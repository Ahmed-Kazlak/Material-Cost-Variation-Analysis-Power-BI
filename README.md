# Material Cost Variation Analysis for Steel Finishing Materials

## üìù Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the material cost variation for steel finishing materials studied in 2021. The analysis compares material costs and costs at completion for supplying and installing these materials on-site. During the project‚Äôs handover in 2024, remaining items were discovered, which led to a study of cost variation. The analysis compares estimated revenue, budgeted costs, approved costs at the project's initiation, and the subcontractor's offer for the remaining items.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel  
- Power BI  

## üåê Data Source:
Data was sourced from project reports, subcontractor offers, and cost documentation, providing key details on estimated revenue, budgeted costs, approved costs, and new offers for the remaining items. This formed the core of the cost analysis.

## üßπ Cleaning and Preparing Process:
1. Collected and structured data from project reports (2021) including estimated revenue, budgeted, and approved costs.
2. Gathered subcontractor offers for the remaining items in 2024.
3. Ensured consistency and accuracy of all data points, focusing on costs for materials and removing installation costs to simplify the analysis.

## üîç Analysis Process:
1. Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
2. Created visualizations including cards for the key cost parameters:
   - Estimated Revenue
   - Budgeted Cost
   - Approved Cost
   - Requested Cost for remaining items
3. Used the DAX function `SELECTEDVALUE` to calculate profit and budget status dynamically based on values chosen from slicers.
4. Established relationships between tables based on the item as a common value with a **1:1 relationship**, and linked the material table to slicers used for calculations.
5. Built tables to display budgeted, approved, and requested costs for materials alone, alongside their percentage variances.
6. Analyzed and compared the cost variations between the original budget and the new subcontractor offers, focusing on the effect on profit margins and budget adherence.

## üìå Key Findings:
- **Gross Profit Analysis**:
   - Gross profit based on budgeted cost: **7.39%**
   - Gross profit if the first project offer price is maintained until project closure: **10.32%**
   - Gross profit if the subcontractor‚Äôs new offer for remaining items is accepted: **-4.03%**
- **Budget Status**:
   - The old offer was **within budget by 3.16%**.
   - The new offer exceeds the budget by **12.34%**.
- **Cost Variation**:
   - Cost difference between the old and new offers for remaining items: **-1.45M**.
   - The average percentage difference between the old and new offers is **-43.89%**.
- **Overall Profit Impact**:
   - The project is expected to face a profit loss of **-14.35%** by the project closure.
